# EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED

A collection of videos to showcase the magic alchemy of computation.

What is computing if you take away all hardware in front of your eyes?

What does computing mean to humanity?

One of my favorite papers in computer science is the original LISP paper by John McCarthy. Written in 1959, it describes something mind-bending: The interpreter for a language in the language that it interprets. If you understand this paper, you understand how computation works.

It wasn't quite the World Wide Web yet, but everybody started hearing about this thing called "the Internet" in 1993. It was being called the Information Superhighway then. This program looks at the earliest stages of the Internet including Aladdin Systems SITComm, a Macintosh communications program for Internet access, and the WELL (Whole Earth Lectronic Link), an early online community. Also featured is a visit to the former Bell Labs in New Jersey (now Bellcore) for demonstrations of internet based teleconferencing, video on demand, ISDN, and optical network technology; a preview of the World Wide Web as used at NASA; a visit to where it all began, ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency in Virgnia; and a look at the Internet Multicasting Service in Washington, the first Internet radio station. Guests include Brendan Kehoe, author of "Zen and the Art of the Internet", Howard Rheingold, author of "The Virtual Community", Dr. Robert Kahn, former found of ARPA, and Carl Malamud, author of "Exploring the Internet".

Virtual reality started out as a science fiction concept in the early 1950s. Now, VR has become a kind of holy grail - lots of promises and claims, few results delivered. This program looks at the state of virtual reality. Demonstrations include the Talking Glove, AutoDesk's Cyberspace project, the Virtual Hand, GestureGlove, CyberGlove, CyberCAD, Virtus Corporation's WalkThrough. Also a visit to the Virtual Reality Showcase at the Software Development Conference in Santa Clara, California.

The science of artificial intelligence is a program to accomplish the Socratic injunction, "Know Thyself." The late John McCarthy, Ph.D., invented LISP, the major language today used for artificial intelligence. Here he discusses the history of artificial intelligence and the future role which non-monotonic reasoning will play in enabling computers to simulate the human mind.

This video is an overview of the Alternate Reality Kit (ARK); an animated environment for creating interactive simulations. ARK is built upon a physical-world metaphor: all objects have an image; a position; a velocity; and can experience forces. Users manipulate objects wiha mouse-operated "hand" which enables them to carry and throw objects; to press buttons; and to operate sliders. Discussion of each ARK feature includes informal observations of early ARK users; an assessment the feature's learnablility; of its usefulness; and of its position on the magical-literal axis.

This talk tells the story of the design of the "windows and mouse" style of user interface, commonly associated with the Apple Macintosh. We start in the 1960's with Sketchpad, NLS and Grail, and see how these seminal ideas influenced the Smalltalk work with children at Xerox PARC. Finally, we explore human psychology and the multi-mentality theories that helped the PARC designer's work.

Also known as the "Mother of All Demos", Doug Engelbart's presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco, December 9, 1968 titled "A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect." For this presentation, Doug and his team astonished the audience by not only relating their research, but demonstrating it live. This was the debut of the mouse, interactive computing, hypermedia, computer supported software engineering, video teleconferencing, etc. See also [Doug's 1968 Demo](http://dougengelbart.org/firsts/dougs-1968-demo.html) page for more background, highlights, links, and the detailed paper published in this conference proceedings.
