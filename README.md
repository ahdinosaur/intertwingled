One of my favorite papers in computer science is the original LISP paper by John McCarthy. Written in 1959, it describes something mind-bending: The interpreter for a language in the language that it interprets. If you understand this paper, you understand how computation works.

Computer code is the next universal language, and its syntax will be limited only by the imaginations of the next generation of programmers. Linda Liukas is helping to educate problem-solving kids, encouraging them to see computers not as mechanical, boring and complicated but as colorful, expressive machines meant to be tinkered with. In this talk, she invites us to imagine a world where the Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow grow up to be optimistic and brave about technology and use it to create a new world that is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird.

We learn and are taught to write software, and a lot of time and effort and research has been put into how to do this well, to varying degrees of success. We learn to evaluate libraries based on external factors like tests and documentation, but often we skip the most obvious part. How do we read source code?

Databases are global, shared, mutable state. That's the way it has been since the 1960s, and no amount of NoSQL has changed that. However, most self-respecting developers have got rid of mutable global variables in their code long ago. So why do we tolerate databases as they are? --- A more promising model, used in some systems, is to think of a database as an always-growing collection of immutable facts. You can query it at some point in time ‚Äî but that's still old, imperative style thinking. A more fruitful approach is to take the streams of facts as they come in, and functionally process them in real-time.

In the past decade, we've seen the rise of powerful social networks of unprecedented scale, connecting millions or even billions of people who can now communicate almost instantaneously. But many of the promises that were made by the creators of the earliest social networking technologies have gone unfulfilled. We'll take a look at some of the unexamined costs, both cultural and social, of the way the web has evolved.

How do we -- as individuals and as communities -- make decisions when faced with uncertainty, inexperience, lack of knowledge or chaos? Nassim N. Taleb and Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman have both devoted their careers to explorations of the decision making process: Kahneman approaching it through psychological study; Taleb through a philosophical lens. Their groundbreaking work has profoundly impacted our understanding of the decision making process today while raising new questions about how decisions are made in a world that is increasingly more difficult to comprehend.

Top Secret Rosies: The Female "Computers" of WWII is a 2010 documentary film directed by LeAnn Erickson. The film is focused on recognizing the contributions of women during WWII, serving as [human computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer) and six of whom went on to program one of the earliest computers, the ENIAC. Their work helped the United States improve the accuracy of weaponry as most conducted ballistics analysis.

Daniel Quinn proposes that the modern environmental crisis has its origins in the agricultural revolution that began about ten thousand years ago. At that time, humans developed a vision of themselves as the pinnacle of creation--a species for whom the entire earth was intended. salvation depends upon our reclaiming our ability to live in harmony with the natural world.

Fuller is considered by some to be one of the 20th century's most noteworthy, controversial and creative thinkers, since his death in 1983. The film looks at his unconventional life, his innovations, and his radical view of the contemporary world. Best known as the inventor of the Geodesic Dome, Fuller had many other inventions, such as an air-streamed three-wheeled car, and ideas of how to "benefit mankind."

This lecture focuses on the problem of creating a scripting system to be used for automating, integrating and customizing the computer services supplied by networked applications and operating systems. Existing solutions are typically monolithic: they do not support scripting services that can be used throughout the system. The design of AppleScript illustrates how to overcome these problems by combining dynamic object-oriented language and database technologies in a distributed, internationalizable scripting system.

It wasn't quite the World Wide Web yet, but everybody started hearing about this thing called "the Internet" in 1993. It was being called the Information Superhighway then. This program looks at the earliest stages of the Internet including Aladdin Systems SITComm, a Macintosh communications program for Internet access, and the WELL (Whole Earth Lectronic Link), an early online community. Also featured is a visit to the former Bell Labs in New Jersey (now Bellcore) for demonstrations of internet based teleconferencing, video on demand, ISDN, and optical network technology; a preview of the World Wide Web as used at NASA; a visit to where it all began, ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency in Virgnia; and a look at the Internet Multicasting Service in Washington, the first Internet radio station.

Virtual reality started out as a science fiction concept in the early 1950s. Now, VR has become a kind of holy grail - lots of promises and claims, few results delivered. This program looks at the state of virtual reality. Demonstrations include the Talking Glove, AutoDesk's Cyberspace project, the Virtual Hand, GestureGlove, CyberGlove, CyberCAD, Virtus Corporation's WalkThrough. Also a visit to the Virtual Reality Showcase at the Software Development Conference in Santa Clara, California.

This video is an overview of the Alternate Reality Kit (ARK); an animated environment for creating interactive simulations. ARK is built upon a physical-world metaphor: all objects have an image; a position; a velocity; and can experience forces. Users manipulate objects wiha mouse-operated "hand" which enables them to carry and throw objects; to press buttons; and to operate sliders. Discussion of each ARK feature includes informal observations of early ARK users; an assessment the feature's learnablility; of its usefulness; and of its position on the magical-literal axis.

This talk tells the story of the design of the "windows and mouse" style of user interface, commonly associated with the Apple Macintosh. We start in the 1960's with Sketchpad, NLS and Grail, and see how these seminal ideas influenced the Smalltalk work with children at Xerox PARC. Finally, we explore human psychology and the multi-mentality theories that helped the PARC designer's work.

Produced ten years after the Rough Sketch this is an updated, finished version, which also reflects advances in theory and research that occurred since the idea for Powers of Ten was first developed. This version adds two powers of ten‚Äîa hundredfold increase‚Äîto each end of the journey into the universe, and to the return trip to the microstructure of the carbon atom in the human body. The site of the journey‚Äôs beginning was changed to a park bordering Chicago‚Äôs Lake Michigan, to allow the journey to approach the disk of the galaxy at approximate right angles.

Powers of Ten: A Rough Sketch for a Proposed Film Dealing with the Powers of Ten and the Relative Size of the Universe is a concept that investigates the idea of an exponential series. This is done by illustrating the relative size of things and the significance of adding a zero to any number: thus, the powers of ten. It begins with a scene on Earth, at a Florida golf course, and then the camera steadily moves away until it reaches the edge of the known universe. As it moves back again to Earth, it continues toward where it began and goes further, reaching to the level of a carbon atom.
